# oncodashkb
## Installation
The project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). You can install like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/oncodash/oncodashkb.git
cd oncodashkb
poetry install
```

Poetry will create a virtual environment according to your configuration (either
centrally or in the project folder). You can activate it by running `poetry
shell` inside the project directory.
